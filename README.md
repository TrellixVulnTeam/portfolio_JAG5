# **Jesse Daniels Portfolio & Personal Website**  

### Goal: Create a personal portfolio of completed projects for my job search

The main purpose of this website is to introduce myself to employers and showcase my HTML, CSS and Javascript skills that I have been working on during my time as a student at Code Louisville. This website also serves as my final project for the May 2021 Javascript cohort of Code Louisville.  

## Current Notable Features 
    1. Header Greeting: Create an array of the days of the week, iterate over it, and display a greeting message which returns the current day.
    2. Character Count: Count the number of characters in the bio and return count. 
    3. Horoscope Feature: Uses fetch method to interact with an API and return  the selected Zodiac. 
    4. Responsive website design using flex design and media queries for common breakpoints: mobile, tablet, and desktop.
    5. Use Sass to implement stylized text effects while remaining accessible. 

## Roadmap
    1. Implement lazy loading on-scroll for images to improve load times. 
    2. Clean up some repetition in the CSS. 
    3. Add skills icons and program familiarities
